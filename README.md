# PyTorch Lightning 3D U-Net

This is a 
[PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PytorchLightning/pytorch-lightning#examples)
implementation of a 3D U-Net.
This implementation tries to be as faithful as possible to the original
[publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650).

## Usage

* Use this repository as a git submodule in your project

## Example

This will describe a toy example with synthetic 3D data. I'm thinking
of something with various geometric object. Perhaps I can find something
elsewhere, I remember some presentation about learning 3D segmentation
from a 2D network.
